1) %% Indexing intro
     200th item: 736, 504th item: 295, 830th item: 130
  
   %% strings and cells
     myCells(1) returns {'robin'}, the cell of the array
     myCells{1} returns 'robin', the value of the array

2)
  a. [logicVector] = contains(myCells,'carrie')
  b. find(logicVector) = 415 %carrie is at place 415
  c. [logicVector] = contains(myCells,'ben')
     find(logicVector) = 544 %ben is at place 544 
Bonus: Alexa is not here.
 [logicVector] = contains(myCells,'alexa')
 zeros(logicVector) %maybe?

% RK 10/14/2020: check what zeros()does! (It is not something that would help you figure this out except in a very oblique way)

3)
  a. ehVector contains an index of trials where all of the 'eh' vowels are located.
  b. waverunner(cd, ehVector, 'signalIn',1,[])
