1. strcmp(string1, string2) is case sensitive.
myName = 'jenna';
strcmp(myName,'Jenna')
This will give me a logical 0. If I do strcmp(myName,'jenna') instead, I will get a logical 1 which prooves it's case sensitive.
2. Yes, 'basic_pythagHypotenuse' will print 'This exists!' because, using an if statement, I told matlab to print 'This exists!' using fprintf if this exists as a file, which it does.
