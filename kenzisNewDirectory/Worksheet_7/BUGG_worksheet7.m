smngLabMembers(2).lab = 'BLAB'
smngLabMembers(2).phdYear = 2017
smngLabMembers(2).smngYears = 2017:2020

sarahsLastYear= smngLabMembers(2).smngYears(end) %The answer I got is 2020! Yay! 
%The second way would be to go through 1, 2, 3 etc until you reach the last
%year. 

SB: Can you think of another way using the 'length' function in just one line? This is a little tricksy.
