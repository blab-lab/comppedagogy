I thought that oldWorkingDir and workingDir to be the same value at first because I didn't necessarily undertand how moving into a different directory would affect the value of the variable. So once I checked the workspace variables, I saw that ans and oldWorkingDir had the same value of comppedagogy, whereas workingDir meant 00_remote_worksheets because I navigated into that folder.
