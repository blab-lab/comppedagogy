% Homework item 1:

% a = 15
% b = 17
% c = 4

% In the workspace side a, side b, and side c were previously 15, 17, and 4.
% Now that we have run the function, these variables that we plugged in have
% been changed to match the function, i.e. they have been changed to a, b, 
% and c because those are the variable names the function uses.

% Homework item 2:

% vectorMin(testVector) should equal 1 (aka the minimum value of the vector)
