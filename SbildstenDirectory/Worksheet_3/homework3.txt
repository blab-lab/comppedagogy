1) the new values I have in my work space are:

hypotenuse = 17
	this was side b but now it is labeled as the hypotenuse, also known as the longest side in the right triangle. I assume this was given this new value because the pythagorean theorem needs to define which side is the longest to know what a^2 + b^2 should egual

nonHype = [15, 4]
	these were thr two smaller numbers so they make up the values  a^2 and b^2 

triangleSides = [15, 17, 4]
	thhis is the last new value in my work space and I believe that these are defined so that matlab could recognize what the three values of the triangle sides were

% RK 10/14: Actually looking for what a, b, and c are! (Compare what a, b, and c are before and after running basic_pythagTripleFunction)

2) vectorMin = 1
