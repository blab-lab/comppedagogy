% RK 9/28/2020: In the future please include question numbers on your answers! 

you would expect the two different variables to have the same output because they are set equal to eachother

% RK 9/28/2020: Reconsider the sequencing of how these variables are assigned! 

oldWorkingDir = 'workingDir'

these two variables are the same. i know this because they have the same dementins and variables.

% RK 9/28/2020: How would Matlab tell you that they are equivalent? Also, they don't have the same variables, they have the same values (the elements of the variables are not variables, they are hard-coded values) 

yes they are equivalent because they have the same dimentions and values

% RK 9/28/2020: try again! 
i would use the command isequal(columnVector,anothercolumnVector) to varify this. I would know I was correct if i recieved a logical variable as the answer.

% RK 9/28/2020: which logical variable? 

newMatrix = [1,2,3;4,5,6]
 anotherMatrix = {'a' 'b' 'c' ; 'd' 'e' 'f'}
